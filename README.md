This study investigates how frontal brain activity
changes across baseline, medication, and meditation conditions
in an individual with ADHD, using daily EEG recordings over a
structured multi-day protocol. By focusing exclusively on frontal
electrode sites, the study reflects real-world constraints while
exploring the reliability and sensitivity of EEG for monitoring
intervention effects. Sessions included a mix of resting and
cognitive tasks, repeated consistently across conditions. The analysis
revealed stable spectral patterns during resting states, with
more dynamic variations during tasks. In particular, stimulant
medication increased frontal theta activity and reduced beta
power, an unexpected shift from conventional ADHD treatment
signatures, while meditation led to a reduced theta-beta ratio and
increased beta power, especially in frontopolar regions. These
results highlight the nuanced effects of each intervention and
underscore the feasibility of using low-channel frontal EEG for
individualized longitudinal monitoring. The study also offers a
transparent and replicable preprocessing pipeline, designed to
ensure artifact robustness and spectral reliability, which may
inform future work in neurophysiology, BCI, and digital mental
health tracking.
